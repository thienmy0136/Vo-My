# Vo-Thi-Thien-My - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, I'm Thien My! 
I have an analytical background in Industrial Engineering and have gained 1-year experience in the field of production as an Industrial Engineer at Jabil Vietnam, located in Saigon High-tech Park, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
During my time as an Engineer, I have developed a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends of production scrap data, and first-pass yield raw data, while exploring the vast world of data visualization, as I am currently developing my visualization skills through enrolling in a Datacamp career track for Data Analyst in Power BI. 

In my free time, I love to curl up with a good book, especially finance and business-related books, or watch my all-time favorite show, The Big Bang Theory! I also love finding opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills through online courses and self-study most of the time. 
Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the excitement of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems and hone my skills along the way.
