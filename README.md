# Vo-Thi-Thien-My - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, I'm Thien My! 
I have an analytical background in Industrial Engineering and have gained 1-year experience in the field of production as an Industrial Engineer at Jabil Vietnam, located in Saigon High-tech Park, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

During my time as an Engineer, I have developed a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends of production scrap data, and first-pass yield raw data, while exploring the vast world of data visualization, as I am currently developing my visualization skills through enrolling in a Datacamp career track for Data Analyst in Power BI. 

In my free time, I love to curl up with a good book, especially finance and business-related books, or watch my all-time favorite show, The Big Bang Theory! I also love finding opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills through online courses and self-study most of the time. 

Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the excitement of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems and hone my skills along the way.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects, and track my progress in my Data Analytics journey.

## Portfolio Project
In this part, I will list data analytics projects and briefly describe the problem and technique used to solve cases. 

### Capstone Design: Modeling the spread of COVID-19 in HCMC during epidemic 4th-wave
**Code:** [Modeling the spread of COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh city using ARIMA model](https://github.com/thienmy0136/Vo-Thi-Thien-My/blob/8966e09f010ab95eae4ff40ef2d11909a67affb3/COVID-19_forecasting-model_Capstone-design.pdf)

**Goal:** Forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam during the biggest wave of the epidemic in 2021 to understand the basics of impact an upcoming wave can have on social and economic aspects

**Description:** This paper shows a quantitative analysis of forecasting confirmed cases of Ho Chi Minh City through the ARIMA model during April 27th, 2021, and November 24th, 2021, while implementing external parameters such as daily vaccination rate, covid-variant incubation period and generation time, as well as social distancing applied for each control policy through Pearsonâ€™s correlation method.

**Skills:** Teamwork, data cleaning, data analysis, data assessment, data visualization

**Technology:** Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels

**Results:** 

The result shows that the forecasting of daily confirmed cases is similar to those of recorded ones; specifically, the model was able to demonstrate the distribution of daily confirmed cases accurately and provided the correct estimation for the two peaks during the fourth wave between April and November which indicates that the implementation of external data is considered adequate and effective to the forecasting model. 

Hence, the government must take action not only on the number of deaths itself but also on the effectiveness of the vaccination rate, and provide sufficient incubation days that help minimize the spread while strictly implementing social distancing policies during the peaks of the epidemic, which can be forecasted based on our simplified model.
