# Vo Thi Thien My - Data Analyst Portfolio
# About
Hello, I'm Thien My! 
I have an analytical background in Industrial Engineering and have gained 1-year experience in the field of production as an Industrial Engineer at Jabil Vietnam, located in Saigon High-tech Park, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

During my time as an Engineer, I have developed a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends of production scrap data, and first-pass yield raw data, while exploring the vast world of data visualization, as I am currently developing my visualization skills through enrolling in a Datacamp career track for Data Analyst in Power BI. 

In my free time, I love to curl up with a good book, especially finance and business-related books, or watch my all-time favorite show, The Big Bang Theory! I also love finding opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills through online courses and self-study most of the time. 

Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the excitement of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems and hone my skills along the way. 

Aside from being an Engineer after graduation, I also have a passion for helping others. While supporting my family, I stumbled upon a job as an Academic IELTS teacher at IMAP, Vietnam, one of the biggest educational institutes that teaches English to Vietnamese. 
During my time working as a teacher (which is a whole new experience for me!), I realize that data is everywhere, and without data and data visualization, I cannot effectively deliver a satisfactory teaching experience to my students and communicate effectively with parents.

The road to the data analytics world for me is not easy, but with my willing-to-learn attitude and not being afraid to ask questions, I know the world of data has so much more to explore.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects, and track my progress in my Data Analytics journey.

# Portfolio Project
In this part, I will list data analytics projects and briefly describe the problem and technique used to solve cases. 

## Capstone Design: Modeling the spread of COVID-19 in HCMC during epidemic 4th-wave
- **Code:** [ARIMA model](https://github.com/thienmy0136/Vo-Thi-Thien-My/blob/3a3cfba15a5c46bbe8550c7c57606148a9bfbbed/Capstone%20stone_ARIMA%20model_python.docx) 

- **Paper** [Modeling the spread of COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh city using ARIMA model](https://github.com/thienmy0136/Vo-Thi-Thien-My/blob/8966e09f010ab95eae4ff40ef2d11909a67affb3/COVID-19_forecasting-model_Capstone-design.pdf)

- **Goal:** Forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam during the biggest wave of the epidemic in 2021 to understand the basics of impact an upcoming wave can have on social and economic aspects

- **Description:** This paper shows a quantitative analysis of forecasting confirmed cases of Ho Chi Minh City through the ARIMA model during April 27th, 2021, and November 24th, 2021, while implementing external parameters such as daily vaccination rate, covid-variant incubation period and generation time, as well as social distancing applied for each control policy through Pearson’s correlation method.

- **Skills:** Teamwork, data cleaning, data analysis, data assessment, data visualization

- **Technology:** Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels

- **Results:** 

The result shows that the forecasting of daily confirmed cases is similar to those of recorded ones; specifically, the model was able to demonstrate the distribution of daily confirmed cases accurately and provided the correct estimation for the two peaks during the fourth wave between April and November which indicates that the implementation of external data is considered adequate and effective to the forecasting model. 

Hence, the government must take action not only on the number of deaths itself but also on the effectiveness of the vaccination rate, and provide sufficient incubation days that help minimize the spread while strictly implementing social distancing policies during the peaks of the epidemic, which can be forecasted based on our simplified model. 


## 2023-Data Analyst NICxGoogle Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success
- **Code:** [Case study 1: Cyclistic Bike-share service data exploration using SQL](https://github.com/thienmy0136/Vo-Thi-Thien-My/blob/2648423b157d4e0cc101a9d3306e10ecfd2fe8cf/Case-study1_Cyclistic%20Data_Google-cert.sql)

- **Report** [Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success](https://github.com/thienmy0136/Vo-Thi-Thien-My/blob/f6b64d701bb2ab742946bef691d309e160cf6407/Case-study-1_Cyclistics%20Data.pdf)

- **Goal:** To determine how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistics bikes differently so as to provide recommendations for future marketing strategy

- **Description:** Cyclistic is a bike share company with a fleet of bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of stations across Chicago. Cyclistic has three pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are annual members. The data used in this case study is a 12-month dataset, from July-2022 to June-2023.

- **Skills:** data cleaning, data processing, data visualization

- **Technology:** postgreSQL, Excel

- **Recommendation**
    - Promotions should happen more often during the weekend as Casual riders use the service to travel to tourist attractions, and this frequency increases during the weekend.
    - Promotion for the service exclusively for new members in Summer should be prioritized as the number of people using the service will peak during that time.
    - Focus more on the credit for how long a person uses the service to travel to tourist attractions in Chicago

## 2022-Modeling Ambulance Service for high-risk epidemic patients in HCMC during the COVID-19 outbreak through ARENA simulation software
- **Code:** [Modeling Ambulance Service for high-risk epidemic patients]()

- **Goal:**
  - Minimize high-risk epidemic patients who are not able to have access to medical assistance regarding COVID-19 and may be exposed to death if they do not receive adequate medical assistance on time.
  - Improve efficiency in the EMS system by balancing out the emergency medical system’s load in epidemic patient admission

- **Description:** Consider an ambulance service modeling for high-risk epidemic patients in Ho Chi Minh City during the fourth wave of COVID-19 started in June, 2021

- **Skills:** data collection, data validation, simulation, data visualization

- **Technology:** Python, ARENA, Excel
  
- **Results:** Through this model, the distribution of ambulances in each area is considered as one of the most important conditions to help increase the number of people who can be saved. In summary, the Ambulance Service (AS) model for COVID-19 has successfully demonstrated the actual situation that happened during the pandemic, where the response time drastically changed among areas, deficient performance in ambulance utilization where there was a big gap in the number of ambulances used among 22 districts.
